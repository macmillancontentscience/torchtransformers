The goal of torchtransformers is to facilitate working with
transformer-based models in R using torch.

This package is under active development, and the API might change
before we reach our first CRAN release. Please check the issues to see
if anything we have planned will impact your use cases.

## Installation

This package currently requires the development version of {torch} from
[this PR](https://github.com/mlverse/torch/pull/828). It should install
automatically when you install torchtransformers, but donâ€™t be confused
when it reinstalls.

You can install the development version of torchtransformers from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("macmillancontentscience/torchtransformers")
```
