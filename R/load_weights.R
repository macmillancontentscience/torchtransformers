# we need the following...
# functions to download/cache the weights (use dlr later for this)
# functions to load the weights into a model.
#  ultimately we want the UI to be something like this:
# pt_bert_model <- load_pretrained("bert_base_uncased")
# ... and either same or different function that can load weights into bert modules
# that's part of large models.

# ok, specific order of things to do:
# make internal variable mapping model names (e.g. "bert_base_uncased") to
# urls of dicts. (done)
# write function to take in url and output R ... thing ... with names/values.
# (this will eventually be improved/cached with dlr)
# write (internal) functions to map weight names...? This might also be something
# that is saved as package data. Decide when I get here.
# to do this, first rename module variables to match standards as much as
# possible. Then any other name mapping that needs to be done should be saved
# with sysdata.


# this is a placeholder for something using dlr.
