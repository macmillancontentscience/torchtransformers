\title{Available BERT Models}
\usage{
available_berts()
}
\value{
A character vector of model names.
}
\description{
List the BERT models that are defined for this package.
}
\details{
Note that some of the models listed here are actually repeats, listed under
different names. For example, "bert_L2H128_uncased" and "bert_tiny_uncased"
point to the same underlying weights. In general, models with the same values
of hyperparameters (accessed by \code{config_bert}) are identical. However, there
is one exception to this: the "bert_base_uncased" and "bert_L12H768_uncased"
models have the same hyperparameters and training regime, but are actually
distinct models with different actual weights. Any differences between the
models are presumably attributable to different random seeds.
