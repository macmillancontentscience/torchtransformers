\usage{
tokenize_bert(
  ...,
  n_tokens = 64L,
  increment_index = TRUE,
  pad_token = "[PAD]",
  cls_token = "[CLS]",
  sep_token = "[SEP]",
  tokenizer = wordpiece::wordpiece_tokenize,

}
\arguments{
\item{...}{One or more character vectors or lists of character vectors.
Currently we support a single character vector, two parallel character
vectors, or a list of length-1 character vectors. If two vectors are
supplied, they are combined pairwise and separated with \code{sep_token}.}

\item{n_tokens}{Integer scalar; the number of tokens expected for each
example.}

\item{increment_index}{Logical; if TRUE, add 1L to all token ids to convert
from the Python-inspired 0-indexed standard to the torch 1-indexed
standard.}

\item{pad_token}{Character scalar; the token to use for padding. Must be
present in the supplied vocabulary.}

\item{cls_token}{Character scalar; the token to use at the start of each
example. Must be present in the supplied vocabulary, or \code{NULL}.}

\item{sep_token}{Character scalar; the token to use at the end of each
segment within each example. Must be present in the supplied vocabulary, or
\code{NULL}.}

\item{tokenizer}{The tokenizer function to use to break up the text. It must
have a \code{vocab} argument.}

\item{vocab}{The vocabulary to use to tokenize the text. This vocabulary must
include the \code{pad_token, cls_token, and sep_token}.}

\item{tokenizer_options}{A named list of additional arguments to pass on to
the tokenizer.}
}
\value{
An object of class "bert_tokens", which is a list containing a matrix
of token ids, a matrix of token type ids, and a matrix of token names.
}
\description{
To be used in a BERT-style model, text must be tokenized. In addition, text
is optionally preceded by a \code{cls_token}, and segments are ended with a
\code{sep_token}. Finally each example must be padded with a
\code{pad_token}, or truncated if necessary (preserving the wrapper tokens).
Many use cases use a matrix of tokens x examples, which can be extracted
directly with the \code{simplify} argument.
